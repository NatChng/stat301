My notes for STAT 301 - Statistical Modelling for Data Science! In our iteration of the class, we had a final project and were not allowed the use of a cheatsheet.

# Study Tips!
In general, focus on understanding high-level concepts when preparing for exams. In particular, knowing how to interpret R outputs and understanding the specific terminology used when communicating findings is key. Making a cheatsheet is good practice.

Coding in the labs and tutorials was more difficult than what was testing in exams. Notably, on exams we generally specified the values of fields in functions, rather than using some of the more complex functions to perform simulations. It's important to go through worksheets to understand why each method was used and what each step does, rather than being able to memorize.

Best of luck!
